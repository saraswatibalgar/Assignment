# Assignment Solutions

This repository contains solutions for three machine learning assignments. Each assignment focuses on a different task, ranging from time series forecasting to image classification.

## Assignment Overview

1. **Time Series Forecasting Script:**
   - Description: This script performs time series forecasting using techniques like ARIMA or LSTM networks. It aims to predict future values based on historical data

2. **Anomaly Detection Algorithm Implementation:**
   - Description: This script implements a basic anomaly detection algorithm from scratch. It identifies anomalies within a dataset using statistical methods or machine learning techniques.


3. **Image Classification Using Pre-trained CNN:**
   - Description: This script performs image classification using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It utilizes transfer learning to classify images into predefined categories.


## Instructions

1. **Running the Scripts:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/saraswatibalgar/assignment.git
     ```

   - Navigate to the directory:

     ```bash
     cd Assignment
     ```

   - Each assignment has its own script. To run a specific assignment, execute the corresponding Python file:

     ```bash
     MATRIX_assignment.ipynb
     Runn this in colab or jupyter-notebook
     ```

2. **Requirements:**
   - Python (version >= 3.6)
   - Required Python libraries are given in requiremnet.txt
